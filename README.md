# FUSE Risk Management Workflow
A repository for FUSE's Risk Management team.

## Background
Currently, all risk management workflows are separated among each team member's local machines using different programming languages. To allow for common development among team members, there is a need to centralize all data and code. This allows greater transparency and increased efficiency in development.

## Objective
The objective of this repository is to centralize all risk management workflows for common development. We intend to migrate our workflow to a dedicated EC2 instance and use GitHub to manage code development and deployment.
